Repository for solutions to https://adventofcode.com/2020

Each day is separated into an isolated folder to see the evolution of the solutions over time. 

To run solutions, first run `npm install` from the root directory, then from the relevant part directory, run `node index.js`

Common file parsing and logic utilities are shared and can be found in `utils.js`
